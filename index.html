      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Church history is the study of the Christian religion and its institutions, as well as the people and events that
      have shaped it over the centuries. It is a broad field that encompasses everything from the early days of
      Christianity to the present day. The study of church history can help us understand how Christianity has evolved
      over time, and how it has been influenced by various cultures and societies.
    </p>
  
    <p>The history of the church can be divided into several periods, including the early church (AD 33-313), the medieval
      church (AD 313-1517), and the modern church (AD 1517-present). Each period has its own unique characteristics and
      challenges, and each has contributed to the development of Christianity as we know it today.
